            <h1>Visualization 1</h1>
            <p> 
                For this visualization, I believed the best way to represent 
                the data would be to create a diverging bar chart. This way it is 
                possible to directly compare the net amount received or donated 
                to other countries. First I got 
                the net amount of usd dollars of donate minus receieved, and then
                for each country, graphed a bar with length corresponding to how much
                recieved(+) or donated(-), and color intensity to represent the amount donated 
                or recieved. I was having a hard time implementing legends, so unfortunately they are
                not included as of yet.

            <h1>Visualization 2</h1>
            <p> 
                For the second visualization, I created a map with a diverging color scale
                to represent the percentage of usd money donated over the total amount donated and receieved. 
                The higher proportion donated to recieved, the more intense blue. 
                While a country that recieves much more than donates will have a more intense red color.
                Countries that have no data remain white. By using a choropleth map, we can see
                relationships between locations where certain color intensities are clustered.
