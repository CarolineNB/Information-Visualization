            <h1>Visualization 1</h1>
            <p style="width:100%;">
                This visualization is a chloropleth grid that uses a diverging color scale
                to show the change of a countries ratio of amount donated to received from 
                the years 1973-2013. I believed using a chloropleth map to show the change in
                ratio answers the question well in that it shows the change of a countries 
                role over the time period. You can see the sudden increase of donations or the 
                sudden decrease of donations by simply looking at the hue and color intensity. 
                The red hue demonstrates more amounts recieved than donated, and the blue hue
                represents more donated than recieved. The more intense the hue, the more 
                that is donated/recieved.

            <h1>Visualization 2</h1>
            <p style="width:100%;">
                For this visualization, I used a multi-line line graph to demonstrate the 
                change in amount of top 10 coalesced disbursements across all countries 
                and time. I believed that for each year, you can see which purpose is mostly 
                donated by seeing which line is the highest, and you can see its relative height
                to other purpose through the difference in height to the other lines.

            <h1>Visualization 3</h1>
            <p style="width:100%;">
                For this visualization, I showed the passage of time by splitting the data 
                into four groups, each of the same period length of 5 years, to answer how
                donations shift geographically over time. Using a single hue color scale
                we can see how the intensity of the hue changes over time, and demonstrate
                how much a country donates (the more donated the more intense the blue).
                Comparing the maps to eachother, we can see the shift in amounts of donations
                all over the world over time.
